To effectively analyze endpoints, user systems, and devices across an entire enterprise in the wake of a security incident, forensic analysts and IT professionals often use Volatility, the open source \"advanced memory forensics framework\" that is used most often in the industry for digital forensics and incident response, to analyze memory images from potentially infected machines to try and discover what system components were affected. In this talk, we will learn how to conduct forensic analysis on Windows machines with Volatility by analyzing a memory image from a Windows machine infected by WannaCry, the malware and worm that recently infected thousands of Windows hosts and rendered entire hospitals and companies useless. Along the way, we will gain a deep understanding of how to use Volatility, as well as common signs to look for on Windows machines that indicate whether you have a malware infection and the types of systems components that will be adversely affected on a detailed level (i.e. Windows malware often injects code via DLL's.

To help focus our tests to only the code we want to validate, Mocking Frameworks are a powerful tool in our toolbox.  Like many tools, if you have an understanding of how the tool works under the hood, you can bend it to your will (and also know where it'll break if you bend too much).\n\nIn this session, you'll learn about the two main types of mocking frameworks: constrained frameworks (like RhinoMocks and Moq) and unconstrained frameworks (such as Typemock Isolator and Telerik JustMock).  I'll dig into how the two actually do their magic and we'll discuss the pros, cons, and limits of both. We'll look at examples of how to use the frameworks in your tests, mocking out dependencies from your own code and even third-party logic.\n\nYou'll get the most out of this session if you're comfortable reading C# code and have a general understanding of class inheritance in .NET, along with some experience writing and running unit tests.

The methodologies developed for software do a poor job of integrating with the complexities cross-functional teams.\n\nAs businesses have struggled, they have turned to consultants and certifications for cookie-cutter \"best-practices\" that often don't fit your organization.\n\nThe solution is to rebuild our understanding of Agile from first-principles so we can build solutions that are tailored to work for us.\n\nScrap the Scrum off your shoes and join us in the collaborative discussion on how to use Modern Agile principles to \"Be Agile\" and not just \"Do Agile\"\n","Room":null,"SessionLength":60,"Tags":[{"Id":1,"Text":"Beginner"},{"Id":8,"Text":"Agile"}],"Speaker":{"Id":92,"DisplayName":"Daniel Heater"},"TimeSlot":{"StartTime":null,"EndTime":null,"DisplayDateTime":"Tuesday, August 15 at 10:52 AM"}},{"Id":122,"Title":"Postgres at any scale","Abstract":"Postgres is a great database for storing your data.

Tools like TeamCity and Jenkins allow users to easily create builds with a user interface.  However, your build logic is tied to your CI server.  Tools like Cake allow  you to decouple your builds from your build server and also provide the advantage that you can run the build locally, which is great. Let us consider the build server debugging dance of commit, wait, fail, commit, wait, fail, commit, wait, success.  With a build that runs locally that cycle is shortened because you can run it locally and you have a working build on every commit. In addition to these benefits, Cake uses C# and the .NET framework , putting thousands of libraries easily in reach for creating plugins to elevate your builds to another layer.

The inverse of this process is looking at what the team has done historically and working backward from that to find the implicit values that have driven team behavior. If we study how we spend time, money and energy, we can cultivate a picture of our values in practice.
