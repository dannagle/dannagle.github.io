[{"Id":872,"Title":"ADHD and Me: How neurodivergence serves my testing","Abstract":"Hi there - *wave* - I’m neurodivergent! That means my brain works in, let’s just say…interesting ways…compared to what some people would call baseline or average. Don’t get me started on how weird the idea of NORMAL is…we’ll be here all day.\r\n\r\nBrains are weird, neat, squishy things. Mine has been diagnosed with conditions like ADHD, anxiety, and depression, with a list of common behaviors that go along with it. To some people, this might sound like terrible news. But, I have a different take on my particular collection of mental conditions. To me, they’re my Super Powers!\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the challenges that I face as a software tester, I want to present you with some examples of how neurodivergence can be harnessed to work for me - instead of against me. Come listen to these stories of how these super powers help boost my curiosity, empathy, and effectiveness. You may just learn something about your own brain along the way.\r\n\r\nMy squad who fights for software quality justice:\r\n- ADHD inspires in me a curiosity to dig below the surface \r\n- Anxiety helps me to empathize with user experience\r\n- Depression/manic cycles train me to use my energy wisely, at the right time","Room":"Ballroom 3","SessionLength":60,"EventId":2023,"Level":{"Id":1,"Text":"Beginner"},"Category":{"Id":44,"Text":"Non-Technical : Other"},"RoomId":3,"TimeSlotId":63,"Tags":[{"Id":28,"Text":"Testing"},{"Id":34,"Text":"Personal Growth"},{"Id":36,"Text":"Life Hacks"},{"Id":50,"Text":"Keynote"},{"Id":73,"Text":"Mental Health"}],"Speakers":[{"Id":501,"DisplayName":"Karen Todd"}],"TimeSlot":{"StartTime":"2023-10-23T14:00:00","EndTime":"2023-10-23T15:30:00","DisplayDateTime":"Monday, October 23 at 9:00 AM"}},{"Id":881,"Title":"Tracking Aircraft with Streams + Software-Defined Radio","Abstract":"Aircraft are everywhere. Knowing exactly where is paramount as it’s considered bad form for two aircraft to be in the same place at the same time. To avoid this, aircraft worldwide constantly and publicly broadcast their location, heading, and all sorts of other data using a system called ADS-B or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast.\r\n\r\nThis data is a natural fit for an event stream. After all, it’s a constant stream of data that is literally being broadcast in real-time. But how can we capture these broadcasts and the data within? Surely it must require expensive hardware and special tools!\r\n\r\nNot so much. It turns out that we can capture ADS-B data easily using a combination of a cheap radio dongle and free software—a combination called software-defined radio. From there we can store it in an event stream and consume, transform, and publish it at our leisure. Cool, right?\r\n\r\nIn this session, you’ll learn how software-defined radio works (and not just for ADB-S), how to receive and store ADS-B data in event streams, and how to use those streams to build a map showing real-time flight data using Node.js, Redis Streams, and whatever front-end JavaScript framework happens to be popular that day!","Room":"Ballroom 1","SessionLength":60,"EventId":2023,"Level":{"Id":1,"Text":"Beginner"},"Category":{"Id":1,"Text":"Languages : JavaScript"},"RoomId":1,"TimeSlotId":64,"Tags":[{"Id":20,"Text":"IoT"},{"Id":29,"Text":"Database"},{"Id":99,"Text":"javascript"},{"Id":378,"Text":"Technical"}],"Speakers":[{"Id":389,"DisplayName":"Guy Royse"}],"TimeSlot":{"StartTime":"2023-10-23T16:00:00","EndTime":"2023-10-23T17:00:00","DisplayDateTime":"Monday, October 23 at 11:00 AM"}},{"Id":959,"Title":"AI for developers: Making your application smarter with Azure Cognitive Services.","Abstract":"Do you want to add AI capabilities to your application but find the prospect of creating your own models overwhelming?
